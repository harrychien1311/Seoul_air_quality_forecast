# Seoul_air_quality_forecast
In this repo, I developed an application to forecast the Seoul's airquality by leveraging the air quality history data from [World's Air pollution website] (https://waqi.info/).
The solution is using an XGBoost regressor model to forecase the next 3 days of Seoul's air quality. The app is deployed in streamlit server
